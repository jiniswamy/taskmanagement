# TODO Application
This application is designed by me to showcase Spring boot technologies.  This is a work in progress.  I hope to highlight many spring modules with this project including Spring Web, JPA, Caching, Security and Validation.  My goal is to develop this as a cloud native application.  The application is a Task Management app powered by REST services.  Currently it has the following features: - 
- Error handling that returns 404 code if a task is not found
- Authenticate user and return  401 code if the user is not authenticated
- Test the services using MockitoJunitRunner 
- Test Controllers
